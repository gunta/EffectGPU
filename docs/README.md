# EffectGPU Documentation

A cohesive overview of the EffectGPU project and navigation to detailed docs.

## What is EffectGPU?
EffectGPU is an idiomatic Effect-based wrapper over TypeGPU. It brings Effect's composability, error safety, dependency injection, and resource-scoped lifecycles to WebGPU programming.

## Quick Links
- Vision: ./effectgpu/vision.md
- TypeGPU Research Summary: ./effectgpu/typegpu-research.md
- EffectGPU Examples: ./effectgpu/examples.md
- TSX DSL (React-style): ./effectgpu/tsx-dsl.md

## Key Concepts
- Effect-first API with explicit error channels
- Services/Layers for DI and testability
- Branded types for type safety
- effectgpu/data: re-export pure schemas from typegpu/data + Effect-wrapped I/O
- Optional TSX DSL inspired by React Three Fiber

## Getting Started
1. Read the Vision for architecture
2. Skim the Research to understand TypeGPU foundations
3. Try the Examples (Effect version)
4. Explore the TSX DSL if you want a declarative component model
